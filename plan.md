## Purpose
FedRAMP Community Working Groups (CWGs) are public, informal and collaborative groups that facilitate industry-led knowledge sharing on commercial and government best practices for information security of cloud services. FedRAMP will rely on the direct engagement provided by CWGs to ensure a smooth transition towards its updated mission of setting standards and policies that enable private innovation to provide solutions to information security problems.
Every FedRAMP CWG has the following primary objectives:

1. Ensure FedRAMP has direct insight into community activities, goals, achievements, best practices, etc. in specific areas to inform creation of standards and policies prior to their formal development.

2. Ensure that FedRAMP stakeholders have equal public access to information from FedRAMP and an open forum and semi-structured opportunities to work towards shared goals in different and innovative ways.


## The Reporting Continuously Community Working Group
The Reporting Continuously CWG is focused on communicating risk. They will identify effective ways for CSPs to communicate their ongoing risk posture, incidents, and continuous improvement activities with agencies and other customers. They will also identify opportunities for communication via automation and standardize communication of ongoing secure decisions enforcement by each CSP. The CWG will explore future models where CSPs are able to continuously represent their risk posture via an ongoing, data-driven ratings rather than gating mechanisms, enabling non-blocking changes while maintaining visibility.

In the future, ongoing risk monitoring will be enforced, validated and reported by continuous technical attestation. CSPs will have a transparent, effective methodology for reporting overall risk posture and incident status via standard customer channels without FedRAMP in the middle.

The following areas are in scope:
- **Data generation:** data is automatically generated from system components (CI/CD, monitoring agents, vulnerability scans, configurations, etc.)
- **Data analysis:** data is normalized and aggregated to transform into information in the form of Key Security Indicators (KSIs) that represent system risk
- **Reporting:** Information is presented to customers in consolidated reports or dashboards that reflect near-real time risk posture, enabling informed, risk based decision making

The scope of the Reporting Continuously CWG is the *who*, *what*, *when*, and *how* for the above areas. The scope of the Reporting Continuously CWG does not include the development of official FedRAMP standards and policies.


### Participation
FedRAMP CWGs are open to the public and all members of the community may participate or follow along. 

The Reporting Continuously CWG is especially relevant for members of the following communities:

Security & Compliance managers at cloud service providers
Etc. (be specificish)


## Key Community Working Groups Activities

**Produce a Methodology for CSPs to Continuously Report Risk**
- Initial Outcome: No later than the conclusion of the first two meetings, create and approve a project plan with overall direction including outcomes, timelines, and milestones

- Strategic Outcome: Continuous Risk Reporting Methodology: Produce specifications for a workable methodology that uses a streamlined, data driven approach to risk reporting. Provide insight into best practices for reporting and communicating security incidents. Provide insights into generating, measuring, and communicating uniform baseline key security indicators (KSIs) that facilitate objective comparison across cloud services while allowing for flexible community-driven extensions. Provide insights into enabling non-blocking changes while maintaining appropriate security visibility and risk awareness for customers.

**Strengthen Collaboration Between FedRAMP and the Private Sector**
- Ensure FedRAMP has direct insight into community activities, goals, achievements, and best practices to inform the creation of standards and policies prior to their formal development.
- Ensure FedRAMP stakeholders have equal, public access to information from FedRAMP, an open forum, and semi-structured opportunities to work towards shared goals in innovative ways.
- Foster a culture/creating a framework where compliance augments security instead of being a roadblock
- Explore approaches to help customers interpret security information and make risk-based decisions using new attestation models.
The Reporting Continuously CWG may involve the following activities:

**GitHub Based Collaboration**
- Maintain a GitHub-based discussion forum where the Community Working Group can collaborate in public (GitHub is chosen because it is an approved GSA cloud service offering that provides community capabilities and is open to use by the public for free. GSA does not have an alternative that meets this criteria). 

**Creation of Supporting Artifacts**
- As necessary, create and maintain code or example architectures that support automated continuous reporting (markdown reporting formats, etc.)


## Interaction with FedRAMP
The Reporting Continuously CWG will be managed by the following member of the FedRAMP PMO:
- John Hamilton [@JohnWHamilton](https://www.github.com/JohnWHamilton)

In addition, the following members of the FedRAMP PMO will support this community as FedRAMP advocates, sharing additional information and addressing feedback as appropriate:
- [@aj-stein-gsa](https://www.github.com/aj-stein-gsa)
- [@sam-aydlette](https://www.github.com/sam-aydlette)

All communication related to this community must take place in public; private messages and emails related to this community will be ignored by the Community Manager and FedRAMP advocates.

Industry professionals should be aware there are limitations on how the federal government and its representatives can engage in CWGs. FedRAMP will not use working groups to seek consensus advice, review formal draft guidance or policies in place of public comment, or direct work on behalf of the government.

FedRAMP’s Disclaimer of Liability and Endorsement applies to all activity from government representatives participating in the CWG: https://fedramp.gov/disclaimer


## Transparency and Communication
This CWG will primarily operate on GitHub in the following repository and Discussion forum:
- [GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/FedRAMP/reporting-continuously/tree/main)
- Link to Discussion Forum
The community manager will host a weekly hour-long town hall for managed discussion, updates, and Q&A:
- Zoom signup link
Recordings from each town hall will be publicly posted on FedRAMP’s YouTube channel as follows:
- YouTube Link, #hashtag / playlist
Every two weeks, the Community Manager will post a Summary of Activity to the CWG that includes the following:
- Recap of questions asked by FedRAMP
- Recap of major topics of discussion
- Recap of major topics from the weekly town halls
- Errata or updates as appropriate
- Expected topics of focus for the next two weeks


## Changes to CWG Operations
FedRAMP Community Working Groups are a new idea that will need to be continuously and incrementally improved. FedRAMP is committed to supporting CWGs throughout the development of FedRAMP 2025 and will provide clear instructions at least thirty days in advance of any significant changes to each CWG.
