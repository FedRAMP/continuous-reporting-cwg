## Purpose
The FedRAMP Reporting Continuously Community Working Group will serve as an informal, collaborative group that facilitates industry-led knowledge sharing. The Reporting Continuously Working Group will help shift toward the new mission of setting standards and policies that empower private companies to create solutions. Enabling private innovation requires ongoing collaboration with the public to represent the government’s goals and expectations. To advance this mission, the Reporting Continuously Working Group aims to improve the FedRAMP authorization processes, accelerate secure cloud adoption across government, and foster collaboration between federal agencies and cloud service providers (CSPs) by providing an opportunity to engage directly with FedRAMP experts and others working to create innovative solutions.

## Scope
The Reporting Continuously Working Group will be an informal, collaborative group; involve voluntary participation of all members; provide transparent information about sessions; and their scope excludes the development of FedRAMP standards and policies.
The Reporting Continuously Working Group is focused on communication. They will identify ways for CSPs to communicate their incidents, risk posture, and continuous improvement activities with agencies and other customers to inform on significant changes. They will also identify opportunities for communicating incident and other reports via automation and standardize communication of ongoing secure decisions enforcement by each CSP. The Working Group will explore future models where agencies are able to continuously represent their risk posture via an ongoing, data-driven rating rather than gating mechanisms, enabling non-blocking changes while maintaining visibility.

## Objectives
- Ensure FedRAMP has direct insight into community activities, goals, achievements, and best practices to inform the creation of standards and policies prior to their formal development.
- Ensure FedRAMP stakeholders have equal, public access to information from FedRAMP, an open forum, and semi-structured opportunities to work towards shared goals in innovative ways.
- Provide insight into best practices for reporting and communicating security incidents
- Provide insights into the right set of uniform baseline security indicators that facilitate objective comparison across cloud services while allowing for flexible community-driven extensions
- Exploring mechanisms that enable non-blocking changes while maintaining appropriate security visibility and risk awareness for customers.
- Fostering a culture/creating a framework where compliance augments security instead of being a roadblock
- Explore approaches to help customers interpret security information and make risk-based decisions using new attestation models.

## Membership and Moderation
The Reporting Continuously Working Group will include representatives from:
- Cloud service providers
- Cybersecurity experts
- Third-party assessment organizations (3PAOs)
- Federal agencies
- FedRAMP

This Working Group will have a technical, engineering implementation approach and so will be primarily practitioner focused. FedRAMP will serve as a facilitator rather than controller of the Working Group's activities. FedRAMP will solicit volunteers to serve as moderators. Members may volunteer to serve as moderators prior to the first group or sub-group meetings through self-nomination or peer-nominations. FedRAMP will review a brief, one-page nomination that represents the nominee’s neutrality, communication skills, domain knowledge, and previous facilitation experience. Moderators are expected to rotate every six months, coinciding with the extension of the Reporting Continuously Working Group.
The Reporting Continuously Working Group is encouraged to partner with industry associations. Potential organizations include:
- Cloud Security Alliance
- ACT IAC
- ATARC
- CSP-AB

## Key Community Working Groups Activities
The Reporting Continuously Working Group may involve the following activities:
- Collecting details on the focus area and general goals for the Community Working Group
- Links to a GitHub-based discussion forum where the Community Working Group can collaborate in public (GitHub is chosen because it is an approved GSA cloud service offering that provides community capabilities and is open to use by the public for free. GSA does not have an alternative that meets this criteria)
- Create definitions around a workable model that uses a streamlined, data driven approach to risk reporting

## Interaction with FedRAMP
FedRAMP will sponsor and host the Reporting Continuously Working Group to provide a neutral space for contributors and information sharing, but will not direct any work. Members of the The Reporting Continuously Working Group may choose to work in public or in private. All activities proposed by FedRAMP will be informative, optional, and public.
FedRAMP will not use the Reporting Continuously Working Group to seek consensus advice, review formal documentation drafts, or direct work on behalf of the government. FedRAMP may draw on the insight provided by observing and interacting with the Reporting Continuously Working Group to create draft guidance or policies that will follow the standard public comment process.
Interaction with individual federal employees does not represent official GSA or FedRAMP policy, and does not represent a commitment on behalf of GSA or the government.
Any software code produced by federal employees must remain in the public domain and will be published in the public GitHub repository.

## Transparency and Communication
The Reporting Continuously Working Group will strive to be as transparent as possible with: 
- Public meeting announcements
- Open participation where possible
- Clear, accessible documentation

The Reporting Continuously Working Group will utilize a combination of asynchronous, discussion forum communication and recurring meetings on specific, published agenda topics. GitHub repositories and discussion forums will be open to the public. Meetings will be available for public participation. All information concerning the Reporting Continuously Working Group will be posted on the respective GitHub repository. FedRAMP will host meetings to summarize the ongoing activities of the Reporting Continuously Working Group and provide a platform for public, synchronous, orderly discussion. Publicly published meeting notes will be made available.
Meetings will include communication norms that aim to foster an open and collaborative discussion:
- Respectful Interaction
- No personal attacks
- Professional language
- Active listening
- Constructive dialogue
- Acknowledge different perspectives
- Participation guidelines
- Equal speaking opportunities
- Rotate discussion leadership
- Encourage diverse viewpoints
- Time-box discussions
- Avoid dominating conversations

## Amendments to the Charter
This charter may be revised as needed to reflect changes in the Reporting Continuously Working Group.

## Expiration and Version History
The charter and the Reporting Continuously Working Group will expire six months after creation unless FedRAMP chooses to continue the group for an additional six months.
